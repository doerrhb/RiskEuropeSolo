    <h1>RISK EUROPE : Règles solo (By Fabian Barock) V3</h1>

    <p><strong>Rules and objective of the game remain unchanged. 1 player and 3 Automatons. You win if you are the first to have 7 crowns.</strong></p>

    <p>For combats, carry out first those of the attacking camp that has the turn, and then in chronological order.</p>

    <h2>SETUP</h2>

    <p>5 coins each, 2 crowns, 10 footmen, 1 castle.</p>

    <p>Choose a color and place the other 3 around the table. You will be the last player in the first round. Randomly draw a capital for the Automaton to your left (who will therefore be the first to play). Place one of its crowns on it, its castle and (X) footmen and (X) footmen on one of the adjacent territories (see following table). Then do the same for the 2nd and then 3rd automaton. Choose a capital for yourself from the remaining 5 (place footmen there and on an adjacent territory that is not a city. 5 in total, without necessarily following the table). Repeat the same with the last 4 capitals, but this time without placing a castle. You will therefore receive the last one.</p>

    <p>Each camp then receives the tax amount from its 2 capitals (+ the starting 5.)</p>

    <p><u>[AUTOMATON CAPITALS (footmen) / AN ADJACENT TERRITORY (footmen).]</u></p>

    <div class="capital-list">
        <p><span class="mark">MADRID</span> (3) / VALENCE (2)</p>

        <p><span class="mark">CONSTANTINOPLE</span> (3) / BULGARIA (2)</p>
    </div>

    <h2>GAME TURN</h2>

    <p>As in the basic rules, choose 2 cards. For the Automatons, take two from their deck and keep them face down, one on top of the other. Start with the first player and follow chronological order.</p>

    <p>When the decks are exhausted, reshuffle them for the Automatons.</p>

    <h2>CARDS FOR THE AUTOMATONS.</h2>

    <p><em>(the rules change for some of them)</em></p>

    <p>If the Automaton absolutely cannot do anything (note, it can always take actions that are not always to its advantage!), draw another card, if possible, from its deck.</p>

    <h3>TAX OR SPEND</h3>

    <p>If the Automaton has 4 or fewer silver coins, it will tax. It will tax the city that would bring it the most. (Usual rules; +1 per connected non-urban territory and + tax value of cities connected to the chosen city). In case of a tie, choose for it the city giving a TAX bonus (if multiple choices, choose randomly with a die).</p>

    <p>If the Automaton has 5 or more silver coins, it will buy. The Automaton <u>NEVER</u> buys a crown card, except if there are no more castles (see following table).</p>

    <p>If there are no more castles available, the Automaton will buy a crown card instead. +2 footmen.</p>

    <p>If there are insufficient figures for its purchases, it buys other units instead (2 footmen for 1 archer and vice versa). Otherwise, it keeps the rest of its money.</p>

    <p><strong>Distribution of units bought by the A.I.</strong></p>

    <p>The castle will go on one of its cities yielding the most taxes that does not have a castle.</p>

    <p>In case of a tie, choose the one with the fewest units. If still tied, choose randomly with a die. For units, distribute evenly among its cities.</p>

    <p>One unit at a time, starting with the cities yielding the most taxes and with the best units (A. Cavalry, B. Archers, C. Footmen. The siege weapon will go on a territory it owns that is closest to an enemy castle. (A. Castle on a city with the highest tax value, B. Castle with the fewest units (each unit counts as 1). In case of a tie, choose randomly with a die).</p>

    <p><u>[Example:]</u></p>

    <p>The Automaton buys 1 cavalry, 1 archer and 2 footmen.</p>

    <p>It has 3 cities. Rome (4), Paris (3 with 2 units) and Buda (3 with 4 units).</p>

    <p>1. 1 cavalry for Rome / 2. 1 archer for Paris / 3. 1 footman for Buda /4. 1 footman for Rome</p>

    <h3>KING ME</h3>

    <p>This Automaton takes the first player token. From the next turn (after everyone's 2 cards have been played and battles resolved), it will become the first player.</p>

    <h3>SPLIT EXPAND OR MANEUVER (see Expand or Maneuver)</h3>

    <!-- image card2.png (replaces media/image2.jpeg) -->
    <img src="card2.png" alt="Split expand or maneuver card" style="width:2.5389in;">

    <p><strong>Rule change:</strong> For <strong>SPLIT EXPEND</strong>, the Automaton will not split an army, but may move one of its armies two spaces towards a city to enter it. However, it cannot cross an enemy territory without stopping there.</p>

    <p><u>[Priority:]</u> <strong>SPLIT EXPEND</strong>, if it cannot enter a city for one reason or another (too far, not enough men for an attack, perform a MANEUVER for it).</p>

    <p><u>[Priority for choosing the city to enter:]</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Having the highest TAX value</li>
        <li>One or two spaces away maximum</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A siege weapon is always required to attack a city with a castle.</p>

    <p>In case of ties: priority to the least defended. If still equal, random draw with a die. If the Automaton has multiple armies that meet these criteria, choose the one that will have the most units once it arrives at its destination.</p>

    <!-- Box: only the two basic rules + priority list (no condition, no thresholds) -->
    <div class="movement-box">
        <p><u>General rules for moving an Automaton's army.</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always leaves one unit on a non-urban territory it leaves.</li>
            <li>If it's a city, it will leave a number equal to the TAX value of that city. The units left in priority are:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Footmen</li>
                    <li>Archers</li>
                    <li>Siege engines</li>
                    <li>Cavalry</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- These lines are outside the box, as separate paragraphs -->
    <p>Condition if it's an enemy territory: you must have enough units. Each unit regardless of type counts for 1.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>He must have upon arrival as many or more units than the defender.</li>
        <li>Except if he has between <strong>6 and 10</strong> units upon arrival, then he may attack an enemy territory that has at most <strong>3 units</strong> more than him.</li>
        <li>If he has between <strong>11 and 15</strong> units upon arrival, he may attack an enemy territory that has at most <strong>4 units</strong> more than him.</li>
        <li>If he has between 16 and 20 units upon arrival, he may attack an enemy territory that has at most <strong>5 units</strong> more than him.</li>
        <li>If he has <strong>21 or more</strong> upon arrival, he may attack without restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>EXPAND OR MANEUVER</h3>

    <p><strong>EXPEND (priority):</strong> The automaton will move an army from a territory towards a city.</p>

    <p>With priority:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The one having the highest TAX value and with its largest army. If not possible, choose another city of lesser value.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If multiple options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With the fewest units.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If there are still multiple choices: random (die)</p>

    <p>If it cannot enter a city with a single move, it will move an army (its largest possible) adjacent to a city (priority its tax value).</p>

    <p>If it cannot make an invasion or move to a territory adjacent to a neutral or enemy city, it will perform a MANEUVER.</p>

    <!-- image card3.png (replaces media/image3.jpeg) -->
    <img src="card3.png" alt="Siege assault, fortify, expand or maneuver card" style="width:2.4375in;">

    <h3>MANEUVER</h3>

    <p><u>[If it cannot do EXPAND or SPLIT EXPEND]</u>, it will perform a maneuver.</p>

    <p>Choose its territory that can bring the most reinforcement to a territory it owns that is being attacked (*). (while respecting the general rules for automaton movement in the following table. If none of its territories are currently being attacked, perform a maneuver to reinforce an army adjacent to an enemy city (priority: 1. With the highest value / 2. With the fewest units).</p>

    <p>(*) If it has multiple cities attacked, it will choose to defend in priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The one that yields the most taxes</li>
        <li>The one that could receive the most reinforcements</li>
        <li>The one that is attacked with the most units</li>
        <li>Draw randomly</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Second box, identical to the first: only the two rules + priority list -->
    <div class="movement-box">
        <p><u>General rules for moving an Automaton's army.</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always leaves one unit on a non-urban territory it leaves.</li>
            <li>If it's a city, it will leave a number equal to the TAX value of that city. The units left in priority are:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Footmen</li>
                    <li>Archers</li>
                    <li>Siege engines</li>
                    <li>Cavalry</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>FORTIFY</h3>

    <p>Is done for the Automaton always first.</p>

    <p>Add 3 footmen to a city or 4 footmen to a castle. The priority is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The one with the fewest units (in case of tie: with the highest TAX value).</li>
        <li>If still equal: A capital wins over a city, otherwise choose randomly with a die.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIEGE ASSAULT</h3>

    <p>Is done for the Automaton always first.</p>

    <p>It obviously needs at least 1 siege weapon. It will choose an adjacent territory with the most enemy units. In case of a tie, it will choose the color of the one that has the most units on the entire board. If still tied, choose randomly.</p>
